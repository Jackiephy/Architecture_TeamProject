We will complete Part 1, 2, 3 and 4 according to Lancaster's Project requirements. The first is Part1. I, Luying Zhang(Alina) is responsible for writing the backend interface, and now upload the contents of Load.java, Memory.java and CPU.java that have already been completed, and then this Github will be the place where we share the code.
